# Machine-Learning-Pattern-Recognition-Assignment

Using data from the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/206/relative+location+of+ct+slices+on+axial+axis) which contain features extracted from slices of CT data, we attempt to guess the height at which the slice was taken using various techniques, such as Bayesian optimisation. All code was written solely in Numpy, using array-based operations to perform the learning.
